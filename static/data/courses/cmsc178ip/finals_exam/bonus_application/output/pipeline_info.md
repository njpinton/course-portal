# Pipeline Challenge

## Degradations Applied (in order):
1. Resolution reduction (512→128→512)
2. Gaussian noise (σ² = 0.01)
3. Contrast reduction (range compressed to 0.15-0.85)
4. Color cast (red +10%, blue -15%)
5. Gaussian blur (σ = 1.5)

## Your Task:
Design a restoration pipeline to recover the image.
Consider the ORDER of operations carefully!
