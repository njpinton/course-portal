    "**Yes**, the sample mean tends to equal the population mean as we increase the number of simulations. This demonstrates the **Central Limit Theorem**, which states that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The sampling distribution of the sample mean is approximately normal\n",
    "2. The mean of the sampling distribution equals the population mean\n",
    "3. The standard deviation of the sampling distribution (standard error) decreases as sample size increases\n",
